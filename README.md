# Cloudflare-WAF-Rule
A Powerful Cloudflare WAF Anti DDoS rule I made for preventing bots, VPNs/Proxies, Old browsers, and Cloud IPs from accessing your website.

## WAF Rule Details

The included items in my Cloudflare WAF rule is:

- Any bot detected by Cloudflare
- Chrome version 30-109
- Many cloud ASNs
- Firefox 30-79

### How to add the rule
- Before deployment please make sure to set the action to block.
- Then choose one of the mirrors (1 and 4 are the best ones because they have a fast CDN)
